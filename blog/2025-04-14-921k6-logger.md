Tell me if this sounds familiar:

You're working on a project and want to log some UART data. Nothing too crazy though, logging to an SD card will work fine (you've got a few of those lying around anyways). 

<!-- truncate -->

You look around and find a few boards on Sparkfun that can log data at a baud rate of 115.2k, but you want to log a bit faster than that. I mean, come on, even an RP2040 supports 921.6k baud nowadays.

Why isn't there a board that you can just power, plug an SD card into, hook up an RX wire, and log some data at a decent baud rate? 

Now there is.

I'd like to introduce you the latest thing we've been cooking up in the lab: 921k6 Logger. Just hook up 5V, an RX wire, GND, and everything sent to the RX line will get logged to the SD card. Simple. 

Even better, with support for exFAT SD cards, you can log to SD cards of any size. No arbitrary 32GB limit from FAT32. We prefer the peace of mind of 128GB because, well, they're only 20 bucks nowadays and we'll never hit that limit, so why not?

3 wires still too many for you? You can plug in the USB for power and GND and only have to connect the RX wire. That makes it easy to power with a standalone battery.
