```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Make sure to build,

```
$ npm run build
```

Then deploy by adding and committing the files then pushing to `main`,

```
$ git push origin main
```
